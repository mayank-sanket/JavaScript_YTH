// Data Types and ECMA standards

// the earlier JS did not have the features of arrows, classes, modules, etc
// but the latest JS has these features

"use strict";   // treats all the JS code as the newer version
// most of the times we don't need to write "use strict"; as the engine automatically treats the code as new version JS but....


// alert("Your device is hacked!") // if you try to run this in TERMINAL (node), you will get an error. To run alert functions, BROWSER is recommended 
// alert(3+3) // we are using nodejs, not browser

// if you want to use alert function in NODE, there is a different syntax for it 

// readability

// console.log(3
//     +3) 

// (valid but not easy to read -- not recommended)

// semicolon is optional in JS but you have to use it when there are two or more instructions in the same line
// eg.

// console.log(3+2); console.log("Mayank")  // here the semicolon was mandatory

// for documentation, use MDN or ECMA. ECMA is the official JS documentation
